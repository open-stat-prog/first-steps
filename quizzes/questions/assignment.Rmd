Question
========
Which of the following commands represents the recommended way to assign the value `7` to the object `y`?

Answerlist
----------
* `y <- 7`
* `y <- 6`
* `y = 7`
* `7 <- y`
* `7 -> y`
* `y == 7`
* `y |> 7`
* `y < 7`
* `y + 7`

Solution
========
Although there are three valid assignment operators: `<-`, `->`, `=`, only the left-facing arrow is recommended by most style guides.

Answerlist
----------
* Correct
* That's the correct assignment operator, but this command assigns the wrong value.
* While `=` is a legal assignment operator, using an equals sign for assignment is not recommended style.
* This isn't legal R code. This command attempts to assign the value `y` to the variable `7`, but variable names can't begin with numbers.
* This is technically valid assignment, but putting the variable on the right-hand side of the assignment operator is not recommended style.
* This is a logical comparison. We're checking if the value of `y` is equal to the `7`.
* This is a misuse of the native R pipe operator.
* This is a logical comparison. We're checking if the value of `y` is less than `7`.
* This command adds the value of `y` to the value of `7` and prints the result.
