Welcome to the *First Steps* module. In this module, you will take the first steps in your R programming journey by
learning the basics of R usage. The module content is broken into four tutorials:

1. [Basic Commands](/tutorials/basic_commands/index.qmd)
1. [R Functions](/tutorials/functions/index.qmd)
1. [Add-On Packages](/tutorials/packages/index.qmd)
1. [Getting Help](/tutorials/help/index.qmd)

Each tutorial will comprise a series of interactive lessons with practice problems embedded throughout. After you complete
each tutorial, you will have the opportunity to complete a knowledge quiz to check your learning.
